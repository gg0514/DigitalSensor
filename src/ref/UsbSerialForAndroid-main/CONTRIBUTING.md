# Contributing to UsbSerialForAndroid

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

This library adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to UsbSerialForAndroid.

These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

This contribution guide was based on one used by the [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) project.

## [Issues](https://github.com/anotherlab/UsbSerialForAndroid/issues)

Issues are created [here](https://github.com/anotherlab/UsbSerialForAndroid/issues/new).

The three most important pieces of information needed to evaluate the report are a description of the bug, the hardware used, and a simple test case to recreate it. It is easier to fix a bug if it can be reproduced. See [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

We will do our best to repond to reported issues that provide information that we can help with. This is not a commercial product and we make no claims or offers to provide any support whatsoever.

If you have a code fix or suggestion, we are only looking at changes submitted as pull requests.


### Issue Closure

Bug reports will be closed if no details are included. If you create an issue for an error and only provide a stack trace, it will be closed.

Issues without a response from the original poster will be closed after 6 months.

_If an issue has been closed and you still feel it's relevant, feel free to add a comment!_

### Languages

We accept issues in _any_ language.  But the maintainers only read English.
When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply.
Anyone may post the translated reply.
In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient.
Having the original text _as well as_ the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

Responses to posted issues may or may not be in the original language.

**Please note** that using non-English as an attempt to circumvent our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/anotherlab/UsbSerialForAndroid/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) will be an immediate, and possibly indefinite, ban from the project.
